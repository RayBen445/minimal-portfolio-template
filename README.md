A clean, simple, and responsive single-page portfolio template built with only HTML and CSS. Perfect for developers, designers, and students to showcase their work.

This repository is a **GitHub Template**. Click the "**Use this template**" button above to create your own new repository with this code.

## How to Customize

It's easy! You only need to edit one file: `index.html`.

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the code on your local machine.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Open the file in any code or text editor.
3.  **Edit the Content:**
    * **Header:** Find the `<header>` section and change "Your Name Here" and "Your Title".
    * **About Me:** Find the section with `id="about"` and replace the placeholder text with your own bio.
    * **Projects:** Find the section with `id="projects"`. Copy the `<div class="project-item">...</div>` block for each project you want to add. Update the `<h3>` (title), `<p>` (description), and `<a>` (link) for each.
    * **Contact:** Find the section with `id="contact"`. Update the links in the `contact-links` list.
        * For email, change `mailto:your.email@example.com`.
        * For GitHub/LinkedIn, change the `href="#"` to your full profile URL.
    * **Footer:** Update the `&copy; 2025 Your Name` in the `<footer>`.
4.  **No edits** are needed for `style.css` unless you want to change the colors!
